            On this website we will explain the procedure to overcome the robot challenge. 
		    The first thing is to create a wireless network to be able to protect our system. 
		    Then we will design some figures for our robotic city, and we will program a robot 
		    to fight against other teams. Our team’s name is Pusbiq.
        </p>
    
        <p><br>
            To decorate the city, we chose to make an automatic barrier and some houses. In order 
		    to connect to the mobile safely, we will create a Wi-Fi subnet with a password and thus 
		    avoid being hacked. We will use HTML code for the website, freecad for the 3D design and 
		    arduino to program the robot that will fight against other teams. The robot will be controlled 
		    with an app on the cellphone.
         </p>
        
        <p><br>
            Regarding the group organization, we started by dividing the work, but we helped each other 
		    if there was any doubt. We also interchanged our tasks so that we didn't do the same thing all 
		    the time and have other perspectives. 
        </p>

        
<h3 class="tres">About us</h3>
    <p>
        We are a team named Pusbiq, made up of the following members: 
        Paula, Unai, Sofía, Alejandro, Irati and Qinzhou.<br><br>

<h3 class="otro">What does it consist of?</h3>
<p>
	Our project consists of creating a robotic city in which a robot fight will take place. 
	The city will be built between all the participating groups and the robots created for the 
	fight will also have to interact with that city.
